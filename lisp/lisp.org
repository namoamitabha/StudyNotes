** TODO Lisp quickstart
   1. ref: http://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/lisp/LispTutorial.html
      1. Lisp string does not terminate with a \0
      2. For tab and return, you can just type tab or return right in the string itself.
      3. nil means false
      4. Every other expression but nil is "true". Official constant t is true
      5. symbol is a series of characters which typically do not contain whitespace, parentheses, pound, quote, double-quote, period, or backquote and among a few others
	 1. Evaluating lists as functions
	    1. Symbols don't take the form of numbers
	    2. Common for symbols to have hyphens(-) or asterisks (*) in them
	    3. case-insensitive
	    4. in lisp, there are no operators, instead, there are only functions
	    5. predicates, return "true" (t) or "false" (nil). traditionally, many lisp predicate names end with a p. such as "numberp", "oddp"
	    6. print: evalutes its argument, then prints it, then returns the argument.
	 2. Control structures and Variables
	    1. function rule: evaluate each argument exactly one time each
	    2. macros or special forms
	       1) used as control structures
	       2) (if test-expression then-expression optional-else-expression)
	       3) if only allows one test-expression, one then-expression, and one optional-else-expression.
	       4) if you need do three things? You need make a block
	    3. progn, (progn expr1 expr2 expr3 ...)
	       1. progn can take any number of expressions, and evaluates each of its expressions in order. progn then returns the value of the last expression
	    4. symbols are also expressions except when they're at the head of a list
	    5. a symbol represents a variable when it's not the head of a list
	    6. Variable are set with macro setf
	       1. (setf variable-symbol expression)
	       2. Lisp doesn't need to declare variables before they are used
	       3. setf will make global variables, unless variables are declared to be local
	    7. let declares local variables with each declaration
	       1) (let (declaration1 declaration2 ...) expr1 expr2 ...)
	       2) let gets rid of the local variables and returns the value of the last expression.
	       3) local variables are only declared within the scope of the let expression
	       4) use setf to change the value of a local variable inside a let statement
	       5) can nest let statements within other let statements
	       6) Locally declared variables may shadow outer local and global variables with the same name
	    8. a list might be a special form or macro is because it repeatedly evaluates its arguments
	    9. (dotimes (var high-val optional-return-val) expr1 expr2 ...)
	 3. Writing functions
	    1. 
      6. lists, 
      7. atom is every expression that is not a list
